# Summary
2023-06-21 Wednesday morning
- first class meeting: 7th floor, Davis Hall
- Professor Kenichi Soga
- Lecturer: Daven Rauchwerk
- Soga Research Group: post-doc researchers, PhD candidates;
- Center for Smart Infrastructure: researchers

## Initial demonstration of June, 2023 status of Large Language Models, GPT-4, LangChain
Video starts nine minutes into initial demo of using GPT-4 to create a variety of questions.

- First session. Introduce SRG, CSI and interns to basic tools of machine learning, LLM, vector DB
	- github; linux and linux shell commands; OpenAI, GPT-4, and GPT-4 playground; structured and unstructured data; CPU and GPU; NVIDIA GPU; open source Large Language Models
- As illustration of new capabilities of Large Language Models, turn Prof. Soga's "Smart City" National Academy of Engineering paper into **SogaChat**. Have it summarize the paper, and create multiple choice quizzes on the fundamental concepts of the paper.
- Discuss **LLM**, **open source**, **OpenAI**, and the process of bringing new text into natural language query system by **embedding** new text.  
- Build SogaChat responses by forming questions to get designed answers
- GPT and machine learning; $20 million to build 100GB text file using 6,000 NVIDIA A-100 80GB to train LLM, built by analyzing a couple of terabytes of text for months.
- 
- illustration with NAE article by Prof. Soga; see online version: [Dr. Soga NAE Bridge](https://www.nae.edu/291015/Smart-Infrastructure-for-Smart-Cities )
- Demonstration: find Soga article in PDF form; extract text; put it somewhere in preparation for "tokenizing"
- Open GPT-4 **playground** page; explain access, token, cost; demonstrate page structure
- Try inserting text in GPT-4 left window, the "system prompt" or "context" window, used to direct GPT how to answer.
-  introduce idea of **embedding**; 
- describe **vector data base**; 
- demonstrate how to construct a query.

## Transcripts
- vtt have timecodes
- generate higher quality transcripts with OpenAI Whisper
- use transcripts to build chat
