# Session 2: What are databases, vector databases, text embedding as vectors, machine learning and large language models [LLM]?
## OpenAI; open source vs commercial models for LLM; why we first use GPT-4
## Building Machine learning [ML] multi-mode models
## What is a vector database, how is it computed, how to use multiple ML's together for querying LLM
## How to build a ML model of every pipe segment in EBMUD
## How to verify the truth of LLM query and responses
## Building and testing SOGACHAT- built on NAE article on smart cities
## Getting a high-level understanding of all of the pieces of AI, ML, and query interfaces
- we cover a lot, but this is a seminar for professors, post-doc researcers, Ph.D. candidates, and university-level students

# Begin by watching the class video:
## An interaction between Dave Rauchwerk, GPT-4, Kenichi Soga, and civil engineering questions: 45 minutes
- [**Video streaming**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qqsh7aXc7keRzTwDafMp1K3_eBnrSWM5/view?usp=sharing); two hours

Start at minute 11:40

- [**Full text transcript**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-70XRgqTichGhUEys0whMsz8KQcFrpAs/view?usp=sharing)
- use the webpage search to find, eg, "vector database", "machine learning", "verification" 
This class is a mutual exploration of new technology, with a focus on engineering applications

# Session 2
2023-06-21 Wed  aft      
# Summary 
Demonstrate SogaChat, an interaction with Professor Soga's article for the National Academy of Engineering on Smart Cities, Digital Twins; 

build **GPT-4** access for all participants; enable GPU access; begin building **Colab** **Jupyter** notebooks
