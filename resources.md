# Resources
{:.no_toc}

## Outline of Computing Resources Used to Create This Course
- Creation of **PipeChat**: Four major web resources woven together: Database, Vector Database, OpenAI API direct access, Oracle Cloud Computing resources
- Augmentation of **PipeChat**: install NVIDIA A-100 80-Gigabyte boards in San Jose Rackspace; augment vectorization and ingestion of text, PDF, file data for LLM queries
- Larger-scale on-line access to NVIDIA H-100 80-Gigabyte boards; arrays of boards
- Exploration of existing LBL Supercomputer: Perlmutter arrays; Texas;  sadly, not designed for continuous updating of LLM vector databases; two to three generation out-of-date hardware; inadequate networking
- Exploration of UCB local computing resources; inadequate power, inadequate hardware resources; lack of fundamental budget
