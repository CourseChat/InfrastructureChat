# Welcome to PipeChat, the application of Large Language Models, Machine Learning, and Interactive Chat to Civil Engineering and Infrastructure
## Goal: Develop A Real-Time Query Environment for Every Aspect of Critical Infrastructure
- Build a Digital Twin from instrumentation, sensors, construction and maintenance records, operational and inspection data, and  phyDsics, chemistry, and biological models.
- Create a body of queries designed to validate responses and analyses performed on the digital twins
- Enable a conversational interaction between engineers, citizens, and elements of physical and cyber systems.

## Build a Critical, Validated Query Environment for Civil Infrastructure
  - Power
  - Water
  - Waste Water
  - Buildings
  - Cyber and cyberphysical systems
### Evaluate and Correct Today's CyberPhysical Systems Lack of Security and Validation
- Develop probes, real-time evaluations, and role-based simulations of complex interactions

- [announcements](announcements.md),
- a [course calendar](calendar.md),
- a [staff](staff.md) page,
- and a weekly [schedule](schedule.md).

- automatic [navigation structure](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/navigation-structure/),
- instant, full-text [search](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/search/) and page indexing,
- and a set of [UI components](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/ui-components) and authoring [utilities](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/utilities).

## Getting Started


### Local development environment

Just the Class requires no special Jekyll plugins and can run on GitHub Pages' standard Jekyll compiler. To setup a local development environment, clone your template repository and follow the GitHub Docs on [Testing your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).
