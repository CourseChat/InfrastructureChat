## About

- This "Quick Course" is less a course than a **series of guided practice sessions** using new tools to interact with large collections of science and engineering articles, books, and data bases. The recent emergence of Large Language Models [LLM], computational vector embeddings of questions and styles of exploration, and new, emerging techniques of validating these interactions suggest a new style of scientific and engineering research and publication.
- 
### Mixing tools and techniques in action: Quick Course Examples
- Use github to build your own web site: Session 
- Building context for queries to GPT-4
- Huggingface Leaderboard as a guide to recent LLM progress
- How to search Github for "Awesome" open source implementations
- how OpenAI and LLaMA open-source compare
- Building your own Embedding pipeline, and how to train and improve creating context
- How to design, generate a bill-of-materials, and build a solar-powered compute hub capable of hosting the vector and relational databases for CSI chat; how to run the newest LLM's on that independent hardware, on or off the Internet
- How to design an emergency response chat to run on mobile phones for first responders and the public in an earthquake, fire or flood.
- How to use vision tools to build complete pipeline to ingest EBMUD paper records of pipe main breaks over past 100 years, OCR both handwritten and printed records, embed results in geospatial and machine learning tools to predict most likely future main breaks
## Lecture One: OpenAi, HuggingFace, and SogaChat
